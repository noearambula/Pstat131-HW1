**Question 1:**

Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

Supervised learning is when we know the outcome/results (Y). We use the given predictors in order to try and find future responses, as mentioned in lecture. We use the results in order to see how good our model predicts each result( we fit our model).

In unsupervised learning we do not have any results/reponses and are trying to learn using only the given predictors. An example model would be clustering while an example model we would use in supervised learning would be regression analysis

**Question 2:**
Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning:

A regression model uses continuous quantative data( or predictors/ x values) to try and predict future responses/ y-values and would be an example of supervised learning because we are given outputs.

A classification model is also an example of supervised learning however here Y is qualitative qith categorical values.

**Question 3:**
Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.
For Regression ML problems: Price and time

For Classification ML problems: survived/died and spam/not spam

**Question 4:**

As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

-   Descriptive models:

-   Inferential models:

-   Predictive models:

**Question 5:**

Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

-   Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

-   In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

-   Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

**Question 6:**

A political candidate's campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

-   Given a voter's profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

-   How would a voter's likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.
