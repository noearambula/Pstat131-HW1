**Question 1:**

Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

Supervised learning is when we know the outcome/results (Y). We use the given predictors in order to try and find future responses, as mentioned in lecture. We use the results in order to see how good our model predicts each result( we fit our model).

In unsupervised learning we do not have any results/reponses and are trying to learn using only the given predictors. An example model would be clustering while an example model we would use in supervised learning would be regression analysis
