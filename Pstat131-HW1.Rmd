# ?mpg
mpg

# Exercise 1 
# ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = hwy)) -> can use this or below

ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram() # creates a histogram

  ## I see highway on the x-axis and count on the y 
  ## The histogram goes from 10 to a bit over 40 on the x-axis and about the same on y
  ## The histogram shows that most cars lie at around 28 mpg on the highway
  ## There is also a spike at around 16 mpg

# Exercise 2
ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = class)) # creates a scatter plot
  
  ## There seems to be a linear relationship between highway and city
  ## this means that as the city mpg go up so does the highway mpg
  ## Gas efficiency improvement leads to efficiency in the city and highway

# Exercise 3 
# was not sure how to reorder bars just using this ggplot(mpg,aes(manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()

mpg_new = mpg %>% count(manufacturer,sort = T) # created a new data set with a count of each manufacturer
mpg_new
ggplot(mpg_new, aes(x = reorder(manufacturer, +n), y = n)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip()

  ## Dodge produced the most cars and Lincoln produced the least

# Exercise 4
ggplot(mpg,aes(hwy,cyl)) + geom_boxplot(aes(group = cyl))

  ## I see a pattern as the number of cylinders go down the mpg on the highway goes up 

# Exercise 5 count(manufacturer)
